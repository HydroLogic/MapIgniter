==== Module Development====

A Module development should respect the MVC arquitecture.

For more information refer to the user [[http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/|CodeIgniter]].

Note: **a module** does not necessarily have to print HTML. You can only specify files for CSS and/or Javascript.

=== Simple Authentication module Example ===

== Controllers ==

   * controllers/auth.php

== Models ==

   * models/account/account_model.php - simple authentication class (may consult with other models, eg database_model)
   * models/account/modauth_lblock.php - layout block class, which indicates the links and scripts to be loaded in the view layout

== Views ==

   * views/auth/auth.php - login form, user session information
   * views/auth/menu.php - contains links to authentication options

== Files to the browser ==

   * web/auth/auth.css - the stylesheet file block authentication (must be indicated in modauth_lblock.php)
